# zfec actually does work at least as well as any package
# works when zipped, but zipping eggs causes various problems
# (http://bugs.python.org/setuptools/issue33 ), and generally makes it
# harder for people to get at the source code, and doesn't actually
# provide any benefits that I am aware of.
